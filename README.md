TODO:
- Update the product image handling to support multiple images, as e-commerce platforms typically showcase products from different angles
- Add pagination and filtering to the getProducts() function for better scalability and user experience
- Expand the authentication flow by introducing scenarios that require specific permissions for certain actions
- Implement environment variables for better configuration management and security
